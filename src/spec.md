# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Surface the app version (set to 8) in the UI so users can confirm they are on Version 8.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a single exported app version constant set to `"8"` as the source of truth.
- Display the version text on the Settings page (e.g., "Version 8").
- Display the version text in the desktop footer within AppLayout (e.g., "Instabook · Version 8"), ensuring it does not break layout on mobile or desktop.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can see "Version 8" in Settings and in the desktop footer, confirming they are using Version 8.
