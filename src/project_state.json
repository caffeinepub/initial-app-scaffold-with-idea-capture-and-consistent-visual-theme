  "summary": "Continue building the Instagram-like social app with admin portal and moderation; rebrand the app everywhere to “Instabook” and add a new logo; fix post click-to-open full-screen view so like/comment/share actions appear and fix messaging send; private accounts should hide posts but keep the profile visible and add follow-request/approval flow; add notifications icon near logout/settings and ensure it is active; replace direct logout with Settings->Logout and show a Settings icon in the top bar; add customer support/problem submission that surfaces to the super-admin (Alok); allow users to delete their own posts; allow users to add/submit new music and filters with names for use in posts and display in feed; strengthen UI/UX significantly and add an in-app Dark Theme option; add user/content reporting UX (with admin review) in addition to support submissions.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Backend implemented as a Motoko canister with DID/TypeScript declarations generated/checked into frontend declarations.",
    "Frontend built with React + Vite + TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS and using shadcn/ui component library.",
    "Authentication uses Internet Identity; actor creation handled in frontend hooks to perform authenticated canister calls.",
    "Introduce strict role-based UI gating: admin-only controls (e.g., per-profile 'Manage' actions) must render only for the super-admin.",
    "Treat user email as sensitive PII: store it securely and enforce backend authorization so only the super-admin can read it.",
    "Rebrand requirement: all user-facing naming should be changed to “Instabook”, with a static logo asset added to the frontend (no backend image routing).",
    "Private account behavior: profile remains visible but posts/media are hidden unless the viewer is an approved follower; requires follow-request + approval state.",
    "Add notifications data model + UI entry point to surface account-related events (e.g., follow requests/acceptances).",
    "Customer support submissions should be stored in backend and readable only by the permanent super-admin (Alok).",
    "User-generated music/filters require moderation controls (at minimum super-admin can remove/approve entries) and must be selectable on Create Post and render metadata in feed."

  "known_issues": [
    "Post click does not open full-screen view; like/comment/share options are missing/non-functional in the post detail view.",
    "Messaging: message send action is failing (messages not sending).",
    "User reports they are not getting admin role/admin UI after deployment (admin privileges not visible for their logged-in account).",
    "Super-admin (Alok) cannot verify/blue-tick other users from their profiles/admin controls as expected (verify/unverify action not available or not working).",
    "Stories/Profile Highlights still show \"Coming soon\" placeholder; expected stories/highlights functionality (and story-like option) not present/working.",
    "Notifications: events are not being generated/displayed (user expects notifications for follow actions and also for search/suggest events, but nothing appears).",
    "Data loss on update: stories and posts are being deleted/wiped after each deployment/upgrade.",
    "Admin Portal: moderation actions (blocking, role management) show as not available / cannot be enabled (backend interface missing or not wired).",
    "Admin Portal: Filters/Music feature-flag toggles are not working (tapping does not enable/disable).",
    "Dark Theme: the dark theme toggle/button does not turn on when tapped (theme does not switch/persist)."
