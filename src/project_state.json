    "Treat user email as sensitive PII: store it securely and enforce backend authorization so only the super-admin can read it.",
    "Rebrand requirement: all user-facing naming should be changed to “Instabook”, with a static logo asset added to the frontend (no backend image routing).",
    "Private account behavior: profile remains visible but posts/media are hidden unless the viewer is an approved follower; requires follow-request + approval state.",

    "Customer support submissions should be stored in backend and readable only by the permanent super-admin (Alok).",
    "User-generated music/filters require moderation controls (at minimum super-admin can remove/approve entries) and must be selectable on Create Post and render metadata in feed."
